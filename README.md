# IMDB Score Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the IMDB scores of movies using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is "movie_metadata.csv" from Kaggle, which contains various attributes and features of movies.

## Dataset

The dataset **movie_metadata.csv** is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), and it contains information about a large number of movies. It includes features such as movie title, director name, actor names, budget, genre, and many more. The target variable in this dataset is the IMDB score, which represents the average user rating on IMDB for a particular movie.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the IMDB scores of movies based on their features. The project will involve the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: This step involves exploring the dataset, understanding the features, and handling any missing or inconsistent data. It may also involve performing data cleaning, feature selection, and feature engineering to prepare the data for model training.

2. **Feature Engineering**: In this step, we will analyze the existing features and create new features that can potentially improve the predictive power of the model. This may include extracting meaningful information from text fields, encoding categorical variables, or creating interaction terms.

3. **Model Selection and Training**: Various machine learning algorithms will be explored and evaluated to select the best model for this task. The dataset will be split into training and testing sets, and the chosen model will be trained using the training data.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model will be evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess its performance and accuracy. This step will help in understanding how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

5. **Model Deployment**: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed for predicting the IMDB scores of new movies. This may involve building a user interface or integrating the model into an existing application.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run this project:

- Python 3.x
